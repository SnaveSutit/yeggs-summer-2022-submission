# TODO
- PvP Kit selection system

- Bee types
  - Attacker bees
    - Hover around the friendly hive until there are enough to attack
    - Fly towards the enemy hive and on contact deal damage to it
  - Defender bees
    - Fly to the nearest undefended 
  - Worker bees



# IDEAS
- Player's armor should be bee themed
