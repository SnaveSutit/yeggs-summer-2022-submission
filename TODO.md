# TODO
- PvP Kit selection system

- Bee types
  - Attacker bees
    - Hover around the friendly hive until there are enough to attack
    - Fly towards the enemy hive and on contact deal damage to it
  - Defender bees
    - Fly to the nearest undefended 
  - Worker bees

- Switch bees over to a state based AI - VERY IMPORTANT FOR PERFORMANCE
- Add a failsafe that teleports bees if they don't reach their target after a certain amount of time
- Figure out how to add a sin wave movement to the bees flight

- Add attribution to bensound.com for music

# IDEAS
- Player's armor should be bee themed
