# TODO
- PvP Kit selection system

- Bee types
  - Attacker bees
    - Hover around the friendly hive until there are enough to attack
    - Fly towards the enemy hive and on contact deal damage to it
  - Defender bees - STRECH GOAL
    - Fly to the nearest undefended generator

- Add a failsafe that teleports bees if they don't reach their target after a certain amount of time

- Add attribution to bensound.com for music

- Add shop system
- Add kit select system
- Add wax generators

# BUGS
- Figure out why drones aren't targeting specifically one team's captured points


# IDEAS
- Player's armor should be bee themed
